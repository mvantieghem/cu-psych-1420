# Assignment 1 is interactive, so you will receive live feedback as you learn to code.
# To begin, make sure you are in the cu-psych-1420 R project.
# Then copy these 3 lines of code into your console and follow the instructions.

# If you don't reach the end of the assignment before the end of lab, you can exit swirl by typing:
bye() 
# next time you log-in, use the same username and it will remember where you left off.
